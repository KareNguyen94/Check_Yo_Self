# Check_Yo_Self
### By John A, Heather F, Karen N.  
  
## Overview of project
Our project is to create a website that allowed a user to make tasks list by adding their own title and tasks while also being
able to remove them with certain buttons. Within the task list their can check off completed task and if all were completed the 
x button would allow them to remove the whole task card. They can also mark their task list to be urgent and it would turn a
different color.  
  
## Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
* clean & organized CSS styles, by the order of our HTML structure and alphabetizing them.
* DRY JavaScript
* localStorage to persist data
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

## Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
Using HTML3 and CSS# to build a a layout from a static comp. Also combining JavaScript to make it functional.  
Some  of our biggest challenge was dividing work between us three and coming back together to figure out what we could merge and 
how to fix it. Also figuring out how to turn our array of non-instantiated objects from local storage back into an instantiation 
of a class.  
One of our biggest wins would be how we worked together as a team to overcome these challenges as a team, having our morning
stand-ups to figure out where we are at and where we need to be.
